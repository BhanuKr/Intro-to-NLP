# Sentiment Analysis and Text Classification

## Project Overview
This project performs **Sentiment Analysis and Text Classification** on a dataset using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify text data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories using natural language processing (NLP) methods.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing
- Text Cleaning
- Tokenization
- Word Embedding with Word2Vec
- Sentiment Classification using Logistic Regression
- Performance Evaluation

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is downloaded via URL and processed for sentiment classification. It consists of text data with corresponding sentiment labels.

## Dependencies
The project uses the following libraries:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- NLTK
- Gensim
- Scikit-learn

To install the required libraries, run:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas nltk gensim scikit-learn
```

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/sentiment-analysis.git
cd sentiment-analysis
```
2. Install the dependencies.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Sentiment_Analysis_and_Text_Classification.ipynb
```

## Project Structure
The project directory is organized as follows:

```bash
├── Sentiment_Analysis_and_Text_Classification.ipynb
├── dataset/            # Dataset files
└── README.md           # Project Documentation
```
Results
The model achieves high accuracy in sentiment classification. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are evaluated.
